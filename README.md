# DRAM-Scheduler
A	program	was	executed,	and	a	trace	was	captured	of	its	memory	accesses.		For	your	convenience,	all	non-memory	instructions	have	been	removed.		A	trace	of	10000	loads	and	stores	is	provided	in	
“sample_memory_sequence.txt”.Your	task	is	to	write	a	DRAM	scheduler .DRAMs	are	explained	in	the	class	notes	from	page	288	to	300.		For	this	problem,	you	will	be	working	with	a	simple	single
-bank	synchronous	DRAM (SDRAM) .		You	will	schedule	a	sequence	of	memory	accesses	such	that	the	timing	characteristics	of	the	SDRAM	are	respected.
